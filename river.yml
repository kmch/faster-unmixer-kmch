# STAPLES
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - cmocean # nice colormaps
  - pandas
  - openpyxl # to open excel files
  - scipy
  - scikit-learn
  - cvxpy # convex optimisation solvers
  - jupyter
  - jupyter_contrib_nbextensions # remember to uncheck 'disable incompatible'
        # go-tos: codefolding, collapsible headings, runtools (alt/option-r to run marked cells)
  - ipykernel
  
  
 # GRAPH THEORY AND PRACTICE 
  - networkx
  - pygraphviz # for networkx plots
  

 # GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS
  - geopandas
  - xarray # numpy arrays endowed with metadata, good e.g. for netCDF4 files
  - bottleneck # speeds up NaN-skipping and rolling window aggregations by a large factor
  - dask
      # Xarray integrates with Dask to support parallel computations
      # and streaming computation on datasets that donâ€™t fit into memory. 
      # Currently, Dask is an entirely optional feature for xarray. 
      # However, the benefits of using Dask are sufficiently strong that Dask may 
      # become a required dependency in a future version of xarray.
  - landlab
  - rasterio # to read topography (ESRI ASCII, GEOTIFF and other formats)
  - netCDF4
  - gdal # ('from osgeo import gdal' or from command line as installed with brew too)
  # - pygmt # it seems better to still use GMT from terminal...
  - gmt  
  - contextily # retrieve tile maps from the internet add them as basemap to matplotlib figs
